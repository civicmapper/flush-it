# Flush-It


# Development

Two commands to run to get the development environment working:

* `python run.py` - runs the Python-Flask development web server. See the site at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
* `watchify main.js -o project/static/js/bundle.js` - watches for changes and runs Browserify to create the javascript build
